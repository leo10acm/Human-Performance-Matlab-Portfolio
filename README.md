CPET Data Analysis Project
This project focuses on the analysis of Cardiopulmonary Exercise Testing (CPET) data using MATLAB. The CPET.xlsx workbook contains the raw data collected during CPET sessions, and the data_analysis.mat script is used to perform data analysis and generate insightful results.

Project Overview
The project aims to analyze CPET data to assess an individual's cardiovascular and pulmonary function during exercise. By analyzing parameters such as oxygen consumption, carbon dioxide production, and ventilation, valuable insights can be gained into an individual's aerobic capacity and overall fitness level.

File Structure
The project directory includes the following files:

CPET.xlsx: This Excel workbook contains the raw CPET data, including variables such as time, heart rate, oxygen consumption, carbon dioxide production, and ventilation.
data_analysis.mat: This MATLAB script is designed to analyze the data in the CPET.xlsx workbook and generate meaningful results.
README.md: This file provides an overview of the project and instructions for usage.
Usage
To use the data_analysis.mat script and analyze the CPET data:

Open the CPET.xlsx workbook and ensure that it contains the relevant data for analysis.
Run MATLAB and navigate to the project directory.
Load the data_analysis.mat script in MATLAB.
Execute the script to perform the data analysis.
The data_analysis.mat script utilizes various functions and algorithms to process the CPET data. It performs calculations, and statistical analysis, and generates visualizations to provide a comprehensive understanding of the individual's physiological responses during exercise.

Customization
The data_analysis.mat script can be customized to meet specific analysis requirements. Users can modify the script to include additional calculations, apply different statistical methods, or generate customized visualizations based on their research goals or specific data characteristics.

Dependencies
The project relies on the following dependencies:

MATLAB
CPET.xlsx workbook (containing the raw data)
